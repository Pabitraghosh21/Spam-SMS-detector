# Spam SMS Identifier

A spam SMS detector is a tool that uses machine learning techniques to identify and filter out unwanted or spam SMS messages. It is designed to protect users from fraudulent, phishing, and scam messages, as well as from unwanted marketing and advertising messages. The goal of a spam SMS detector is to accurately identify spam messages and prevent them from reaching the user, while also allowing legitimate messages to pass through. This can be achieved through the use of various techniques such as natural language processing, machine learning algorithms, and artificial intelligence. The spam SMS detector can be implemented as a standalone application or as a component of a larger messaging system.
## Roadmap

Step 1: Input - This step involves collecting and organizing the data that will be used for the classification process.

Step 2: Cleaning and Preprocessing - In this step, the data is cleaned and prepared for analysis. This may include tasks such as removing duplicates, correcting errors, and formatting the data in a consistent manner.

Step 3: Feature Extraction and Selection - In this step, the most relevant features are identified and selected for use in the classification process. This may involve selecting a subset of the available features, or creating new features through transformation or combination of existing features.

Step 4: Classification (Naive Bayes) - In this step, the selected features are used to train a Naive Bayes classifier, which is then used to classify the data as spam or ham.

Step 5: Output (Spam/Ham) - The final step in the process is the output of the classification results, indicating whether the data is classified as spam or ham.
